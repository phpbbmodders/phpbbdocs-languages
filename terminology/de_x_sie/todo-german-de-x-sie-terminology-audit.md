# Exhaustive German terminology audit

This audit cross-references UI terms across all seven end-user
chapters (`admin_guide.xml`, `user_guide.xml`, `moderator_guide.xml`,
`quick_start_guide.xml`, `upgrade_guide.xml`, `server_guide.xml`,
`glossary.xml`) and all 50 developer-doc files under
`dev-docs-docbook/de_x_sie/` against phpBB's real German (Formal
Honorifics) language pack (`phpbb-de/phpbb-translation`,
`language/de_x_sie/`).

All seven chapters — `admin_guide.xml`, `user_guide.xml`,
`moderator_guide.xml`, `quick_start_guide.xml`, `upgrade_guide.xml`,
`server_guide.xml`, `glossary.xml` — have had the exact same
exhaustive treatment: every `<guilabel>`/`<guimenuitem>`/`<title>`
string in every chapter has been individually traced to its English
source line and resolved, not sampled. Real mismatches were found and
fixed in `admin_guide.xml` and `user_guide.xml`, not just close
paraphrases but different literal button and field labels, and in
several cases an entire feature described with the wrong term: the
"Manage extensions" pages being confused with phpBB's unrelated
Extensions/mods feature, predefined permission-role names like
"Vollmoderator" not matching the real "Umfassender Moderator",
"Moderatorkontrollzentrum"/"Administrationskontrollzentrum" not
matching the real "Moderations-Bereich"/"Administrations-Bereich", and
several search/sort dropdown labels and a private-message button whose
wording didn't match the real strings (see the commit log for the full
list). `moderator_guide.xml`, `quick_start_guide.xml`,
`upgrade_guide.xml`, `server_guide.xml`, and `glossary.xml` came back
clean under the same exhaustive check — no fixes needed, though each
turned up a small number of strings genuinely unconfirmable against
the fetched language pack (see the supplementary glossary below).

All 50 dev-docs files have had a full read-through against their
English originals. Dev-docs reference far fewer phpBB UI strings than
the end-user chapters, so this review was mostly about translation
fidelity and technical accuracy rather than `<guilabel>` matching. It
found and fixed two real translation bugs: a mistranslated "or" that
read as a contradiction, in `language/guidelines.dbk` and
`language/validation.dbk`. It also turned up a handful of
factual/numeric errors — an off-by-one in `database_types_list.dbk`'s
int ranges, broken smart-quotes in a code sample in
`tutorial_key_concepts.dbk`, an inconsistent version number in
`tutorial_basics.dbk` — but these are present identically in the
English source, so they're upstream content bugs rather than
translation errors; they're left as-is and out of this audit's scope.

`admin_guide.xml` started this audit with 219 unmatched
`<guilabel>`/`<guimenuitem>`/`<title>` strings. Every single one of
them has since been individually traced to its English source line,
matched against a real phpBB language key where one exists, and
resolved — around 75 turned out to be genuine mismatches and were
fixed (wrong ACP page titles, dropdown labels, table column headers,
password-complexity and settings descriptions that didn't match the
real board's wording). The remaining 144 are not open questions; each
has a specific, checked reason it isn't a translation bug:

- **Confirmed correct, flagged only by a crude string comparison** —
  the real value matches exactly once you account for inline
  `<code>`/`<em>` markup in the source PHP file, curly quotes, or two
  separate real strings concatenated with a slash (e.g.
  "Aktivieren/Deaktivieren" = the real `ACTIVATE` + `DEACTIVATE`
  values joined).
- **Grammatical case forms** of an already-correct term (dative/
  genitive), which will never literally match the pack's dictionary
  form — e.g. "Namens des Boards" is the correct genitive of "Name des
  Boards".
- **Colon or hyphenation differences only** — the real language pack
  never stores the trailing colon a form label gets in the template,
  and a few compound nouns are hyphenated differently without changing
  meaning.
- **Untranslated technical strings by design** — product names (AOL/
  MSN Messenger, the Fulltext search engine names), file paths
  (`images/avatars/upload`), template placeholder tokens (`NUMBER`,
  `TEXT`, `INCLUDEPHP`), and bare acronyms (`PHP`, `URL`).
- **Descriptive section/chapter titles**, mirroring the English
  source's own non-literal heading style (e.g. "Adding a bot",
  "Database backup and restore") rather than quoting a real UI string
  — this covers the great majority of `<title>`-tagged entries.
- **Pre-existing content issues shared identically by the English
  source** — e.g. the "Maximum thumbnail filesize" setting's
  description matches a `MIN_THUMB_FILESIZE`-shaped behavior in both
  languages, and "Recompile stale templates" describes an
  older/renamed feature; these are flagged for awareness, not silently
  patched in German only, since fixing only the translation would fork
  it from the (equally wrong) English original. Both were confirmed as
  genuine documentation bugs by phpBB dev team lead Marc (09/2026); a
  fix isn't expected soon since phpBB 4.0 work has priority right now.
- **Genuinely unconfirmed** — a small residual set, across every
  chapter (not just `admin_guide.xml`), where no matching key could be
  found in the fetched reference files at all. These are listed, with
  the reasoning behind each one, in the fillable
  [`german-de-x-sie-supplementary-glossary.md`](german-de-x-sie-supplementary-glossary.md)
  rather than repeated here.

## How to do this

For each `<guilabel>`/`<guimenuitem>`/`<title>` string, identify the
real phpBB language key it corresponds to (grep the relevant
`language/de_x_sie/` or `language/de_x_sie/acp/` file from
[phpbb-de/phpbb-translation](https://github.com/phpbb-de/phpbb-translation)
by its English string first, via `language/en/`, to find the key, then
check the German value) and fix the document if it differs. Watch for
false positives from crude string matching: inline `<code>`/`<em>`
markup inside the PHP source, curly vs straight quotes, and labels
built by concatenating two separate keys all cause a real match to
look unmatched. When the English source itself is a non-literal
paraphrase of a heading or description (not a literal UI quote), the
German mirroring that same paraphrase is not a bug. Verify with a real
`./phpbbdocs_hugo.sh de_x_sie` build afterward.

**Where this applies to future dev-docs edits:** any `.dbk` file under
`dev-docs-docbook/de_x_sie/`. **How:** if the new or edited text
references a literal phpBB UI string (a button, field, menu item, or
page name the reader would actually click), wrap it in `<guilabel>` or
`<guimenuitem>` and run it through the same check as above before
merging — if there's no matching key, add a row to
[`german-de-x-sie-supplementary-glossary.md`](german-de-x-sie-supplementary-glossary.md)
instead of leaving it unverified.

That check covers literal UI quotes only. For everything else in
dev-docs, reference proper German wording in place of awkward or
not-well-placed phrasing when you see it — same as any translation
review.
